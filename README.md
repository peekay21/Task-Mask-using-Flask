# Task-Mask-using-Flask
## In this project, I created a Front-end using HTML5, which consists of a table with three columns 1. Task 2. Added data 3. Action i. Update ii. Delete
## In the backend, using SQLite, with table structure. The table has three fields, 1. Id (Primary Key) 2. Content (string))
## In this project, Tasks are created from the frontend, by taking input in the input field. using 'ADD TASK', adding the value to the SQLite database. Show the records in the above table.
## The project motive is that to implement the Flask web framework.
