# Task-Mask-using-Flask
## In this project, I created a Front-end using HTML5, which consists of Table with three columns 1. Task 2. Added data 3. Action i. Update ii. Delete
## and in the backend, used sqlite, with table structure. Table has three fields, 1. Id (Primary Key) 2. Content (string) 3. date (Date)
## In this project, Tasks are created from frontend, by entering in input field. using 'ADD TASK', added the value to the sqlite database. Show the record in the above table.
## Projects motive is that to implement the Flask web framework.
